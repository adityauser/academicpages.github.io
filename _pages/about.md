Hi, my name is Aditya. I was born in Siliguri, India. Currently, I'm living in Varanasi and pursuing Integrated Dual Degree(B.Tech, M.Tech) in Mathematics and Computing at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi.

I used to think that how do we make decisions, how to be certain that our decision is correct/good for the future, how humans learn to recall from their previous observations? And finally, how can we encapsulate all these things in a single Algorithm/Model? These questions motivate me to work on Machine Learning. I believe Machine Learning can make our machines intelligent at least it is a fist good way to look into.
Especially, I have some high expectation Reinforcement learning because here we don't need labels. The agent learns from environment Dynamics and rewards itself.

In RL I'm most interested in:
- Solving board games
- Distributional RL
- Reproducibility issues in RL algorithms

I am fortunate to have interacted and worked with many amazing people on exciting topics. I always feel excited to explore more and work in amazing areas of RL research.
